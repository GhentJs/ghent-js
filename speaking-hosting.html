        <h1>Speaking or hosting</h1>
        <p>Are you interested in speaking at one of our meetups or do you know a great location to host one of our meetups? <strong>Awesome!</strong></p>
        <p>You can reach out to us by DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ghentjs) and we'll get back to you.<br />We do have a couple of guidelines to determine if your talk is suited for our meetup or your space can be used to host us.</p>


        <h2>Speaking</h2>

        <p>All talks should be given in English, besides that <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the only requirement.</p>

        <p>We're a framework agnostic meetup group, so topics about any framework, or no framework at all are welcome.<br />
        Backend or frontend, jQuery or Handlebars, basically anything goes. Just don't come promote your product/service.</p>

        <p>We don't require any speaker level or credentials to verify.</p>


        <h2>Hosting</h2>
        <p>We're pretty easy in terms of hosting our meetup.</p>

        <p>We're looking for locations in Ghent that can host about 30-50 people. We can limit the amount of attendees based on what your location allows, but this is what we aim for.</p>

        <p>Speakers should be able to project their slides/code/presentation to the audience. An audio setup with speakers is only necessary when the space is too big to be used without a microphone.</p>

        <p>Parking space for cars, bikes, ... is a nice to have. Providing food is definitely not a requirement.</p>
